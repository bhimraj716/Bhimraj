    <h2>Donald Trump's official portrait: The 17th Century painting that unlocks this mysterious image</h2>
    <img src="images/image123.jpg.webp" alt="">
    <p>Following the release of the US president-elect's official portrait, an expert reveals how scouring the pages of art history can help decode its meaning.
        Whether your politics align with those of Donald Trump or not, it is difficult to deny that a string of recent photographs of the former-and-future president of the United States are as visually arresting as any in US political history – instantly etching themselves into cultural consciousness. 
        The release of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly443wxl78o">Trump's official presidential portrait </a> last week, ahead of today's inauguration, completes a triptych of striking images that began with the circulation in late August 2023 of his booking photo, taken after he was indicted in Georgia for conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election. That image, the mugshot heard around the world, was followed, almost a year later, by the astonishing photo of a blood-streaked then-candidate Trump, defiantly pumping his fist in the air after being struck in the right ear by a would-be assassin's bullet.</p>
        <blockquote>Carefully choreographed, every aspect of the official photo is calibrated for maximum impact – from the almost metallic, crepuscular light in which Trump's face is ignited from below to his severe, asymmetrical squint</blockquote>
        <p>Captivating as those first two earlier photos are, the most recent portrait, taken by Trump's chief photographer, Daniel Torok, and released by his transition team in the lead up to Trump's retaking of the oath of office, may be the most extraordinary of them all. There is simply no precedent in US presidential portraiture for the piercing intensity of expression and hawkish thrust of stare the image enshrines – an aggressiveness of gaze for which one must scour the pages of art history to find a compelling parallel.</p>
        <img src="images/p0kkw825.jpg.webp" alt="">
        <p>Although Trump may have deliberately sculpted his defiant pose for his mugshot in Atlanta, the staging of neither that photograph nor the dramatic image captured in the chaotic moments after the attempt on his life in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July 2024, were under his control. Torok's was. Carefully choreographed, every aspect of the official photo is calibrated for maximum impact – from the almost metallic, crepuscular light in which Trump's face is ignited from below to his severe, asymmetrical squint. The photographer nailed it.
        </p>
        <p>Traditionally, official presidential photographs (even Trump's own from eight years ago, when he first assumed the high office) are designed to communicate openness and affability. They are serene, smiley, and, almost invariably, forgettable. They seem to say, "better days are on their way". Not this one. The portentous image is a steely statement of impending purpose. Though journalists have endeavoured to distil the portrait's essence into everyday language, auditioning words like "scowl" and "stern", Trump's expression resists easy captioning. It is, well, strange.</p>
